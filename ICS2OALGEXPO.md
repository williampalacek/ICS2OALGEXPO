Not able to solve Pyraminx and learning algorithms.

AO3 = DNF          AO5 = DNF          AO12 = DNF

#### 02/14/20
Solved under 30 seconds just trying to get it consistent since I only got it once out of the 12 times I tried.

AO3 = 1:08          AO5 = 55          AO12 = 57.3

#### 02/18/20
Currently manipulating algorithms to make my times faster

AO3 = 56.4         AO5 =  50.1         AO12 = 49
