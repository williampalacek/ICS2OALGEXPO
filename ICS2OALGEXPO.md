Not able to solve Pyraminx and learning algorithms.

AO3 = DNF          AO5 = DNF          AO12 = DNF

#### 02/14/20
Solved under 30 seconds just trying to get it consistent since I only got it once out of the 12 times I tried.

AO3 = 1:08          AO5 = 55          AO12 = 57.3

Currently manipulating algorithms to make my times faster.

AO3 = 56.4         AO5 =  50.1         AO12 = 49

#### 02/20/20
I solved in 17 seconds!!

AO3 = 24.17         AO5 = 29.32           AO12 = 27.4

Seem to be solving just as fast as last time with no imporvment.

AO3 = 27.27         AO5 = 24.23           AO12 = 29.54

#### 02/25/20
I solved in 14.26 seconds today.

AO3 = 19.24         AO5 = 19.82           AO12 = 20.46

My valitated no inspection A03= 25.5183333
