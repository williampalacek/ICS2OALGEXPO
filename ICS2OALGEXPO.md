### 02/13/20
Not able to solve Pyraminx and learning algorithms.
### 02/14/20
Solved under 30 seconds just trying to get it consistent since I only got it once out of the 12 times I tried.

AO3 = 1:08          AO5 = 55          AO12 = 57.3

Currently manipulating algorithms to make my times faster

AO3 =          AO5 =           AO12 =
